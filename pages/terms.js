                    and other suppliers of travel services shown on your
                    itinerary. We are not responsible for the acts or omissions
                    of such suppliers or their subcontractors or their failure
                    to provide services, adhere to their own schedules, or honor
                    their contracts. Nor are we responsible for any omissions,
                    delays, failures to make connections, re-routings, or acts
                    of any governmental authority, or for damage and/or delay
                    due to causes beyond our control such as labor disputes,
                    bankruptcy, defaults, mechanical breakdowns, pandemics,
                    epidemics, quarantines, government restraints, weather
                    problems, volcanic activity, earthquakes, terrorism, or
                    threat of terrorism. Each supplier has its own terms and
                    conditions that are applicable to your particular
                    arrangements in addition to this Agreement.

                  <p>
                    We have no special knowledge regarding foreign entry
                    requirements, unsafe conditions, terrorism, health hazards,
                    weather hazards, supplier bankruptcies, or the suitability
                    for a disabled person of any portion of any trip. For
                    information concerning possible dangers at destinations, we
                    recommend going to the State Department travel website at
                    www.travel.state.gov. For information about passports and
                    visas, and possible dangers at your destinations, go to:
                    https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html, click on "Find
                    International travel Information� then click on "Country
                    Information", and fill in the name of the destination
                    country. For medical and health information, we recommend
                    contacting the Centers for Disease Control at (877) FYI-TRIP
                    or www.cdc.gov/travel. You assume full and complete
                    responsibility for checking and verifying any and all
                    passport, visa, vaccination, or other entry requirements of
                    your destination and your connecting points, and all
                    conditions regarding health, safety, security, political
                    stability, and labor or civil unrest at such destination.
                    Many countries require your passport to be valid for six
                    months beyond the date of entry.

                  <p>
                    You agree to pay us a ticketing fee of up to $450.00 per
                    ticket booked through the website. If we must issue a new
                    ticket in exchange for a ticket already issued, you also
                    agree to pay us a fee of up to $450.00 for the exchange.

                    <b>4. TICKETING, CHANGES AND REFUNDS</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For all trips, you must have made full payment before we
                    release the tickets or documents. You acknowledge and
                    understand that airlines can increase their prices at any
                    time before tickets are issued. You hereby consent to any
                    such price increases and authorize your credit card to be
                    used for them. Once we forward your payment to the airline
                    or other travel supplier, your tickets and other travel
                    arrangements become non-refundable and non-changeable, and
                    you will not receive any refund if you cancel or change your
                    booking. If the travel supplier cancels or reschedules for
                    any reason, we may extend a credit toward a future trip to
                    the same geographical region in our sole discretion. The
                    foregoing is our sole responsibility in connection with the
                    supplier�s cancellation or rescheduling of any trip. If you
                    miss your flight, missed flights are not refundable, and
                    changes or replacement flights will be at the discretion of
                    the airline. In some cases, we may be able to help you, but
                    in most cases you will not be provided with a replacement
                    flight unless the airline itself allows it. If all or any
                    portion of an itinerary is not used for any reason, payment
                    is forfeited.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Schedule changes are quite common today. We urge you to
                    re-check exact flight times prior to departure and prior to
                    your return. Flight delays are also common today. If your
                    domestic flight or your US-originating foreign flight on a
                    US airline is delayed for any reason, the airlines are not
                    required by law to compensate you or pay for your enroute
                    expenses, such as meals, hotels, taxes and phone calls. WE
                    STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRAVEL INSURANCE FOR ALL YOUR TRAVEL
                    PLANS.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As soon as you receive your booked itinerary, check it
                    thoroughly to make sure it is correct as to dates, times,
                    fares, and rates. We recommend that you check your itinerary
                    periodically and take note of any schedule changes. We have
                    no responsibility for losses and inconvenience arising from
                    your failure to check your itinerary prior to your departure
                    date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you have any questions or concerns about your itinerary,
                    or if your ticket is not honored for any reason, you must

                    DO NOT CONTACT THE AIRLINE DIRECTLY. Direct contact with any

                    booked, may result in cancellation of your booking. If your
                    ticket is not honored, we will replace your ticket with an
                    acceptable alternative of equal value or more within 24

                    You agree you will only use our website or services to make
                    legitimate reservations or purchases and shall not make
                    speculative, false or fraudulent reservations or
                    reservations in anticipation of demand. You will only use
                    our website and services in compliance with applicable law.
                    You agree not to purchase a ticket or tickets containing
                    flight segments that you will not be using, such as a
                    "point-beyond", "hidden-city", or "back-to-back tickets".
                    You further agree not to purchase a round-trip ticket that
                    you plan to use only for one-way travel. You acknowledge
                    that the airlines generally prohibit all such tickets, and
                    therefore we do not guarantee that the airline will honor
                    your ticket or tickets. If you do not use one of the flights
                    in your reservation, the airline will cancel your remaining
                    itinerary. You agree to indemnify us against airline claims
                    for the difference between the full fare of your actual
                    itinerary and the value of the ticket or tickets that you
                    purchased.

                  <p>
                    Purchases made on this website are transacted exclusively in
                    United States Dollars (USD). If you make a purchase from us
                    using a non-USD-denominated credit or debit card, please be
                    aware that, due to the constant fluctuation in exchange
                    rates, the charge to your card or the estimated charge
                    amount we provide you, may differ based on the exchange rate
                    at the time you make your reservation versus the rate at the
                    time the charge is reflected on your credit card statement.
                    Also, in the event that we must credit your account, we will
                    refund the exact USD amount initially charged and will not
                    be responsible for any fluctuations in exchange rates which
                    may cause differences in your billing statement.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When you submit your credit or debit card for a purchase, we
                    request an authorization for the amount of your anticipated
                    transaction (placing a temporary "hold" on the funds). If
                    for some reason we are unable to confirm your booking, you
                    will not be charged and we will request that such hold be
                    released by your credit or debit card bank; until then,
                    funds subject to the hold will not be available to you for
                    other purposes. We bear no responsibility in the event your
                    credit or debit card is not approved or charged.

                    We use stringent safety measures for credit card payment
                    processing. Fraudulent transactions, if any, are reported to
                    airport security, airlines, and other federal and state law
                    enforcement.

                    You agree to be liable for any and all credit card payments.
                    Please do not dispute the entire credit card charge or
                    initiate a chargeback due to any act or omission of any
                    airline or other supplier; otherwise, we will have to absorb
                    a big loss. If a supplier does not provide the service or
                    ceases operations, your recourse is against the supplier,

                    transactions are determined to be high risk by our systems,
                    we will not process such transactions unless our credit card
                    verification team has determined that it is safe to process
                    them. In order to establish validity of such transactions,
                    we may contact you or your bank. As our client, you hereby
                    appoint us to be your attorneys-in-fact for the purpose of
                    signing all documents necessary to purchase and issue
                    airline tickets, tours, cruises, and hotel guarantees for
                    late arrival. You authorize any of the attorneys-in-fact to
                    sign credit card authorizations for said purchases whenever
                    any of them receives an Internet booking request reasonably
                    believed to be from you or someone acting on your behalf,
                    requesting those tickets be charged to this credit card
                    account. You agree that you will pay for all such purchases
                    and will not hold us responsible for any of our actions
                    pursuant to this power of attorney. At our request, at any
                    time before or after your trip, you agree to sign a credit
                    card charge form and to send us any proof of your identity
                    that we may require. If we suspect that an attempted charge
                    is fraudulent, we retain the right to void the transaction
                    immediately.
